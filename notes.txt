# Implement: 
	- A class(es) that calculates the tendency to either attack or defend.
    - A set of testing environments to see how the algorithm would react:
        run a series of command on all of the ships and shipayrd to make them
        orient in a certain way.
	- A class that predict the most possible move by the near by ship:
		- Check the ship's N,S,W,E and choose the one the most number of halites
		and if the cargo was more than mine then go and vice-versa
